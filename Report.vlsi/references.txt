abstract="ARM TrustZone is a hardware isolation mechanism to improve software security. Despite its widespread availability in mobile and embedded devices, development of software for it has been hampered by a lack of openly available emulation and development frameworks. In this paper we provide a comprehensive open-source software environment for experiments with ARM TrustZone, based on the foundations of the well known open-source QEMU platform emulator. Our software framework is complemented by a prototype kernel running within a trusted environment. We validate our software environment with an application example featuring a software based Trusted Platform Module hosted in a TrustZone protected runtime environment and an Android operating system accessing it through an high-level, industry-standard Trusted Computing API.",

It emulates several CPUs (x86, PowerPC, ARM and Sparc) on several hosts (x86, PowerPC, ARM, Sparc, Alpha and MIPS). QEMU supports full system emulation in which a complete and unmodified operating system is run in a virtual machine and Linux user mode emulation where a Linux process compiled for one target CPU can be run on another CPU.},

abstract="The TrustZone technology, available in the vast majority of recent Arm processors, allows the execution of code inside a so-called secure world. It effectively provides hardware-isolated areas of the processor for sensitive data and code, i.e., a trusted execution environment (TEE). The Op-Tee framework provides a collection of toolchain, open-source libraries and secure kernel specifically geared to develop applications for TrustZone. This paper presents an in-depth performance- and energy-wise study of TrustZone using the Op-Tee framework, including secure storage and the cost of switching between secure and unsecure worlds, using emulated and hardware measurements.",

abstract = {Recently, sensitive information such as financial data and electronic payment systems have been stored in mobile devices. To protect important data, TEE technology has emerged, a trusty and safe execution environment. In particular, ARM TrustZone technology, which is mainly used in mobile, divides one physical processor into Normal World and Secure World to provide a safer execution environment. Many manufacturers have started using TrustZone technology, but existing commercial TEEs have limitations in conducting security research using TrustZone. Therefore, this paper shows how to use OP-TEE which is an open source project for implementing ARM TrustZone technology and TEE Client API that communicates with Trusted Application of TrustZone Secure World. To demystify TEE Client API, we implemented a simple trusted application for communication between Normal World and Secure World in OP-TEE OS using QEMU emulator.},

abstract = {Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) are widely deployed, especially on smartphones. A recent trend in TEE development is the transition from vendor-controlled, single-purpose TEEs to open TEEs that host Trusted Applications (TAs) from multiple sources with independent tasks. This transition is expected to create a TA ecosystem needed for providing stronger and customized security to apps and OS running in the Rich Execution Environment (REE). However, the transition also poses two security challenges: enlarged attack surface resulted from the increased complexity of TAs and TEEs; the lack of trust (or isolation) among TAs and the TEE.  In this paper, we first present a comprehensive analysis on the recent CVEs related to TEE and the need of multiple TEE scheme. We then propose TEEv, a TEE virtualization architecture that supports multiple isolated, restricted TEE instances (i.e., vTEEs) running concurrently. Relying on a tiny hypervisor (we call it TEE-visor), TEEv allows TEE instances from different vendors to run in isolation on the same smartphone and to host their own TAs. Therefore, a compromised vTEE cannot affect its peers or REE; TAs no longer have to run in untrusted/unsuitable TEEs. We have implemented TEEv on a development board and a real smartphone, which runs multiple commercial TEE instances from different vendors with very small porting effort. Our evaluation results show that TEEv can isolate vTEEs and defend all known attacks on TEE with only mild performance overhead.},
